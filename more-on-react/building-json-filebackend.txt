//We can build a JSON backend server to access and change our data.
//this is help preventing the access of data fromm local storage
//the data we'll store iin json development api/server will be loaded using the useState hook at the start of the render of application


STEPS---
1. create a data folder and create a json file
2. run the command in another terminal npx json-server -p 3500(write port value other than the app server) -w data/file.json
3. Now you can use the entered port as backend storage and push a get or post request to it
4. Finally you can watch the api requests on the terminal and use the resource url as api to access by developers
